            <h3>COMPUTER</h3>
            <p>In 2018, the best PCs continue to grow more and more advanced, and Computex 2018 was proof of this. However,
              if you want to stay ahead of the curve these days, having one of the best PCs is absolutely essential. Even
              if all you do is browse the internet, you can run into slow-downs just by viewing too many advertisements.
              That’s why the best PCs are still better than smartphone and, arguably, the best 2-in-1 laptops that some would
              say replaced them. The best computers will also be easy to upgrade beyond a simple RAM swap – so you can easily
              keep them up to date. With the wide range of low-power processors like the ones announced by Intel recently,
              you can have the power benefits that the best laptops offer. And, as a bonus, all eight of these computers
              will work with all the latest and greatest components – feel free to slap one of the best graphics cards in
              there if you want one of the best gaming PCs. However, finding the best PC for your needs isn’t as easy at
              it might sound. When we made this list, we did so acknowledging that the best computers strike a balance between
              value and performance. With that, we’ve comprehensively tested, reviewed and ranked each PC we’ve got our hands
              on over the last year or so to find the best computer you can buy today.</p>

            <p>We're over halfway through September (how did that happen?), and now that the major tech events of the year have
              passed, this is the best time to buy a new laptop, and our best laptops of 2018 guide is here to help. We've
              gathered together the best laptops money can buy, no matter what kind of laptop you're looking for. So, we've
              got the top thin and light ultrabooks, budget laptops and the very best laptops for gaming on as well. Every
              laptop on this list has been carefully tested and reviewed by us to make sure that only the very best laptops
              are included, and we're constantly updating this guide with the latest releases... as long as they are good
              enough! So, with our recommendations, along with our very own price comparison tool, it's never been easier
              to buy the best laptop for your needs.</p>

            <h3>TELEPHONES</h3>
            <p>
              It's been a big week in the world of smartphones, with the launch of the Samsung Galaxy Note 9 making waves with its incredible
              power. But despite being one the highest-spec phones on the market right now, it's also up there in terms of
              expense and a lot of the features might not apply to everyone... but boy, it ran the Samsung Galaxy S9 Plus
              close as the best phone in the world. We know that it's not all about the high-cost, super spec phones all
              the time so we've made you a handy list of all the top smartphones that you can get on the market right now,
              assessing what really matters to you, the buyer. We test these phones rigorously, making sure that we check
              every angle and feature - but most importantly, considering whether they've got a decent battery, great screen,
              strong design and a cracking camera. On top of that, they can't be too exorbitant in price either - not everyone
              wants or can afford a supercar of a handset, so we've made sure there are plenty of options for you there.
              If you do want to focus on the cheaper side of things, then check out our list of the best budget phones of
              2018 for some great ideas. Still here? Still thinking about which phone to go for? Don't worry... there are
              15 excellent options to choose from.</p>

            <h3>TABLETES</h3>
            <p>Our selection of the best Android, iPad and Windows tablets.</p>
            <P>Our list for the best tablet in 2018 is dominated by Apple, Samsung, Microsoft, Asus and Huawei, all of which
              offer big screens in small packages and 2-in-1 versatility. Today's top tablets are primed to be part-time
              laptop replacements for many people, and that means offering at least a nice keyboard and desktop-like software
              features. They have to be portable, but powerful enough for your workflow. You're going to find Apple's iPad
              Pro with iOS 12 in the lead thanks to its strong app ecosystem, but there are some standout Android tablets,
              too. The best Windows tablet also makes a showing on our top 10 tablets list. We rank tablets based on multiple
              factors, including performance, battery life and screen quality, with price playing an all-important role in
              the final verdict. Take note: some new tablets don't offer great value, even if they're a smidgen better (see
              the Samsung Galaxy Tab S4 vs the Tab S3 as a great example). Here are the best tablets you can buy, though
              things can change at any moment, especially if the iPad Pro 2018 launches in Octobe</P>
